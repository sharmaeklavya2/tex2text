We study an extension of 2D geometric bin packing.
Here each item $i$ is a rectangle of width $w(i)$ and height $h(i)$
that has $d$ nonnegative weights $v_1(i), v_2(i), \ldots, v_d(i)$ associated with it.
Our goal is to compute an axis-parallel non-overlapping packing of the items into bins so that
for all $j \in [d]$, the sum of the $j\Th$ weight of items in each bin is at most 1.
Despite being well studied in practice, surprisingly,
approximation algorithms for this problem have rarely been explored.
We first obtain two simple algorithms having asymptotic approximation ratios (AARs)
$6(d+1)$ and $3(1 + \ln(d+1) + \eps)$.
We then extend the Round-and-Approx (R\&A) framework
\texorpdfstring{\cite{bansal2014binpacking}}{[Bansal-Khan, SODA'14]}
to wider classes of algorithms, and show how it can be adapted to this problem.
Using more sophisticated techniques, we obtain algorithms having
an AAR of $2(1+\ln((d+4)/2))+\eps$,
which improves to $2.919+\eps$ for the special case of $d=1$.
